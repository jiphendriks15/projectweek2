<h3>Japan was an inspiration for van Gogh</h3>

<p>Van Gogh first learn about Japanese art in Paris. There Vincent discovered the impact Eastern art had on the West when he wanted to modernize his art. Vincent bought his first stack of Japanese woodcuts in Antwerp. He saw them as artistic examples and rated the woodcuts as highly as the classical high points in Western art history. Japanese artists often omitted the central plan in their compositions. Objects in the foreground were sometimes magnified. They also regularly kept the horizon out of the picture. Or opted for abrupt cut-offs of the image elements at the edge. </p>

<p>Vincent took over the Japanese finds. What appealed to him was the unusual spatial effect, the large surfaces in strong colours, the everyday subjects and the attention to details from nature. And the exotic and cheerful, of course. It wasn't just copying. This was partly due to Vincent's artist friend Émile Bernard. He developed new ideas about the direction of modern art. Taking the Japanese prints as an example, he stylized his own paintings. He used large areas in simple colors and firm contour lines.</p>

<p>Inspired by Bernard, Vincent also subordinated the illusion of depth to the flat surface. In his paintings he did combine that pursuit of flatness with his own swirling brushstroke. Like Gauguin, Vincent believed that artists should go to more southern, primitive regions in search of bold colours. That would help them develop the art further. With this idea he went to Arles.
